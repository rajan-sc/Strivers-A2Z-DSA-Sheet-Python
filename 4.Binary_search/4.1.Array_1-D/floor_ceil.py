"""
Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array

Given a sorted array nums and an integer x.
Find the floor and ceil of x in nums.
The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.
If no floor or ceil exists, output -1.
