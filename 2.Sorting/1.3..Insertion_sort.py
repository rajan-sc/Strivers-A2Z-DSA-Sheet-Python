Same as deck of cards in your hand you place 1 card first which is already sorted and then add the cards before or after it.

key = arr[i] â†’ pick the current element.

Compare it with the sorted portion (arr[0..i-1]).

While elements are smaller than key (because descending order), shift them right.

Insert key at the correct position (j + 1).
